# Memory Game

This is the final project (Project 4) for the **Web Front-End Foundations Nanodegree Program by Udacity**.

The objective is to build a classic memory game (pair matching) using the three languages learned throughout the course: *HTML*, *CSS* and *JS*.

### Prerequisites

A device (desktop/laptop/tablet/smartphone) with an internet browser in its latest version installed.

This game is supposed to work in any major browser such as:

* Mozilla Firefox
* Google Chrome
* Safari
* Opera
* Microsoft Edge

## About the project

The game consists of three files, as follows:

* *index.html* - content
* *app.css* - styling
* *app.js* - game engine (logic)

## How to play the game

When the page loads, the timer starts and every card that is clicked gets fliped out and the 'Moves' counter is incremented.

Whenever two cards are matched (same picture), they change color and become unclickable.

## Winning the game

The game ends when all the 8 possible card combinations are revealed.

When the game is over, a popup will show you the final score including: star-rating, number of moves and total time spent.

## Built With
